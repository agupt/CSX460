$name works for list not for vector
[[..]] -- reach inside
[..] -- slice
data struct

vector share same data type
list probably mix data type / names collection of tyoe
data.frame similar to sql table / underneat list of vector / vector is col vector / all vectors are same size / row are mazor i.e. considers row first
data.frame data can be accessed by names
data.frame slow
data.table put frames on steriods
data.table[where clause, select clause]

packages

check lecture slides
devetools is awesome to group reusable code into packages
search() --> prints loaded packages


continus reponse is called REGRESSION
categorical response is called CLassififcation

supervised learning netflix erecomendation
unsupervised learning group customer in group ??? test data availability


start with naive guess, you know this is incorrect if your model is not doing better its close to naive


Loss function

measure of error is observed - predicted
error properties of model is the main motivator to measure model
square of difference foloowed by square root RMSE
other way couldbe absolute followed by mean


Important things to any ML Algo

errors measurement ==> loss function
model ==> restrict class of function to predict values
search ==> process and select from restrict class of function or models

search

lenier model
always use it
R --> lm
fit <- lm(formula=FE ~ CarlineClassDesc + EngDispl,data = dat)
fit <- lm(formula=FE ~ .,data = dat)
fit <- lm(formula=FE ~ EngDispl,data = dat)
